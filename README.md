### A tool for checking minecraft accounts => by Tails Development Team

### Known bugs / update logs,
```
> The tool will NOT send a message after completing the check
> The tool will NOT check every single account, 
|> Especially when there's a proxy giving almost weird errors, were trying to figure that out
|> After a proxy has been removed, it continues to the next acc from the list

(Note) The tool might be updated at a later date as decode currently working on a full proxy support.
â€¢ Combos/Proxies list selection fixed, you can now select using explorer from anywhere if the files are missing.
```
