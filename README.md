### A tool for checking minecraft accounts => by Tails Development Team

### Known bugs / recent logs,
`# The tool might be updated at a later date as decode currently working on a full proxy support.

> The tool will NOT send a message after completing the check
> The tool will NOT check every single account, 
|> Especially when there's a proxy giving almost weird errors, were trying to figure that out
|> After a proxy has been removed, it continues to the next acc from the list`
